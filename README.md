# FreeToLove
An InZOI mod that makes every Zoi attracted to every gender

## Why
In the current version every Zoi seems generated with the same pattern which seems to "looking for a relationship" and is always attracted only to the opposite gender.
This is a known issue and the devs are working on it, [see here](https://playinzoi.com/en/news/8432)

## What
This mod brutally fixes the issue by making every Zoi attracted to every available gender. 

Your game will still lack variety because every Zoi will have to same preferences but at least you can try having a relationship with every Zoi your heart desires.

## What do you need

1) The latest **experimental** version of Unreal Engine 4/5 Scripting System available [HERE](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases/tag/experimental-latest). You will need only UE4SS_v3.0.1.zip (filename may vary).
2) The contents of this repository

## How to install

1) Find the folder where you installed inZOI and extract the contents of UE4SS in **\BlueClient\Binaries\Win64**
2) Extract the contents of this repository in the newly created Mods folder in **\BlueClient\Binaries\Win64**. You should have this folder structure: Mods/FreeToLove/Scripts
3) Open **mods.txt** in the newly created Mods folder and add this line: ```FreeToLove : 1```
4) Open inZOI and **when the world is completely loaded and you have control of your Zoi** press **F12**
5) Save the game

You can check if everything worked correctly by interacting with a Zoi and opening the little summary menu (the little icon next to the Zoi name when you interact). It should say "Attracted To: Male, Female, Nonbinary".
